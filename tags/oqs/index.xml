As we learned the basic notion of quantum mechanics, uncertainty principle, the measurement in quantum theory results in probability. As people usually discuss the average of an observable, its variance, however, is not discussed in the scope. We discuss a basic quantity in quantum transport - variance of the current. Two systems are discussed, 1) closed system with magnetic flux which is also known as persistent current; 2) open quantum system of simple connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1802.02121 (LA-UR-18-20615)
In this work, we study transport in a simple triangle quantum-dot metastructures. By modeling the systems as open quantum systems, circulating current is found without external magnetic field/vector potential. The same finding is also discovered in isolated systems. The models and results can be tested in proposed experiments. This study reveals interesting transport phenomenon in non-trivial topology and geometry of the quantum systems.
